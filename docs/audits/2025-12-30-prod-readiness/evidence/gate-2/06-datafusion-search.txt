Gate 2 Evidence: DataFusion search

CORRECTION (2025-12-31): Original search results were incomplete. DataFusion IS present.

Command:
rg -n "datafusion" /Users/ethanurbanski/arco --glob "*.rs" --glob "Cargo.toml" --glob "Cargo.lock"

Result (corrected):
/Users/ethanurbanski/arco/crates/arco-test-utils/Cargo.toml:33:datafusion = "46"
/Users/ethanurbanski/arco/crates/arco-test-utils/tests/tier2.rs:15:use datafusion::prelude::{ParquetReadOptions, SessionContext};
/Users/ethanurbanski/arco/crates/arco-test-utils/tests/tier2.rs:1248:async fn datafusion_reads_parquet_bytes() {
/Users/ethanurbanski/arco/Cargo.lock:1893:name = "datafusion"
(plus 100+ Cargo.lock entries for datafusion-* subcrates)

Summary:
- DataFusion IS a dependency of arco-test-utils (version 46)
- DataFusion IS used in tier2 integration tests
- Test `datafusion_reads_parquet_bytes` validates Parquet read compatibility
- Test execution evidence: release_evidence/2025-12-30-catalog-mvp/ci-logs/tier2-tests.txt

Clarification:
- DataFusion is used in TESTS to validate Parquet compatibility
- DataFusion is NOT integrated as a production "server read path" feature yet
- Browser reads use DuckDB-WASM; server reads are Tier-1/Tier-2 direct Parquet I/O
- Technical Vision mentions DataFusion as future server read option
