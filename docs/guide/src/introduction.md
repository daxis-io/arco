# Introduction

Arco is a serverless lakehouse infrastructure that unifies a file-native catalog with execution-first orchestration.

## Key Features

- **Metadata as files**: Parquet-first storage for catalog and operational metadata
- **Query-native reads**: Direct SQL access via signed URLs
- **Lineage-by-execution**: Real lineage from actual runs, not parsed SQL
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Enforced at storage and service boundaries

## Who is Arco for?

- Data platform teams building modern lakehouses
- Organizations needing unified catalog and orchestration
- Teams wanting operational metadata as queryable data
