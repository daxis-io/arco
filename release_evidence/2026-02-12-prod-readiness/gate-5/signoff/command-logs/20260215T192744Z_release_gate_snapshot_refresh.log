1	NO-GO	Signed release tag provenance and SBOM/release-note enforcement evidence not yet produced.
4	PARTIAL	Fresh 2026-02-15 execution reran Terraform, Cloud Run/IAM, and observability command matrices with archived logs. Local Terraform + observability checks remain reproducible, but authenticated staging apply, Cloud Run/IAM data capture, live staging observability evidence, and human drill signoff are still externally blocked.
5	NO-GO	Fresh Gate 5 evidence captured (policy/security/rollback/signoff docs + command logs), but soak/load closure remains blocked by benchmark regression, missing load tooling, and required staging execution; pen-test, rollback drill, and human signoffs remain unresolved.
7	NO-GO	Final readiness report/handoff is published, but canary progression and production integration validation remain externally blocked; messaging update gate remains closed because non-GO gates still exist.
