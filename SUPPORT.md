# Support

## Getting Help

- Usage questions: open a GitHub Discussion.
- Bug reports: open a GitHub Issue with reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.
- Security issues: follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and avoid public disclosure until triaged.

## What to Include

When requesting help, include:

- Arco version/commit.
- Environment details.
- Minimal reproduction.
- Relevant logs or error traces.

## Response Expectations

Support is best-effort. Maintainers prioritize:

1. Security and data integrity issues.
2. Reproducible correctness bugs.
3. Documentation gaps with clear impact.
4. General usage questions.

## Commercial/Enterprise Support

If formal support expectations are needed, open a discussion describing requirements.
