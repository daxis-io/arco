# Signal Ledger - 2026-02-12 Prod Readiness

- Ledger date: 2026-02-12
- Evidence refresh UTC: 2026-02-18T19:04:52Z
- Baseline commit: `e896506f3c936c266a21fe556a107d37bd7075b5`
- Definition of Done: every signal below is `GO`, and every gate is `GO`.

Status values:
- `GO`: closure condition satisfied with reproducible evidence
- `PARTIAL`: implementation/evidence exists but closure condition not fully met
- `NO-GO`: unresolved signal; gate cannot be closed
- `BLOCKED-EXTERNAL`: requires staging/prod infra activity or external security/perf execution
