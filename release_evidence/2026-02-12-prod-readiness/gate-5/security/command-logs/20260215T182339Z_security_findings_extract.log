89:### 1.3 Are there any hardcoded secrets or credentials?
91:**Answer:** Found only test fixtures (no production secrets observed in reviewed Rust/Terraform).
223:- JWKS/rotation is not implemented; a draft `JwtVerifier` exists but is not compiled or wired (`crates/arco-api/src/lib.rs:52`, `crates/arco-api/src/auth.rs:30`).
383:- Parity docs call out engine/client auth schemes (SigV4, Google Auth, token rotation/revocation); current API supports debug headers or `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` only (`crates/arco-api/src/context.rs:80`, `crates/arco-api/src/context.rs:237`).
477:- Unknown: repository-wide enforcement that “secrets never in events” (e.g., schema validation hooks) was not evaluated in this pass.
481:- Add a “secrets-invariants” regression suite that fails if secrets appear in logs/events (redaction + event validation).
519:| No JWKS/rotation for JWT verification | Key rotation operational risk; manual key distribution | Track JWKS implementation; add `jwks_url` + caching + alg allowlist |
547:| **JWKS support** | JWT-6 | Missing | `auth.rs` exists but not wired. Current JWT validation uses static secret/public key. JWKS requires caching, rotation, and `kid` selection logic. | `plan-deltas.md:218` (PR-13) |
