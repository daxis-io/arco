# Governance

## Project Structure

Arco uses a maintainer-based governance model.

### Roles

- **Maintainers**: Full commit access, can merge PRs and make releases
- **Reviewers**: Can approve PRs but not merge
- **Contributors**: Anyone who contributes code, docs, or issues

### Decision Making

- **Minor changes**: Single maintainer approval
- **Significant changes**: Two maintainer approvals
- **Architectural changes**: Consensus among maintainers + ADR

### Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions may be nominated by existing maintainers.

See [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) for the current list.
