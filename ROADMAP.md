# Roadmap

This roadmap is directional and may evolve as architecture and operational feedback matures.

## Near Term

- Harden parity gates and repository hygiene checks.
- Complete mdBook-first documentation coverage for install, quickstart, concepts, and reference.
- Tighten orchestration correctness and replay guarantees.
- Improve API contract coverage and OpenAPI consistency checks.

## Mid Term

- Expand multi-tenant operational controls and observability defaults.
- Improve data/catalog recovery workflows and failure drills.
- Strengthen integration tests for orchestration + catalog interactions.

## Longer Term

- Stabilize public APIs toward a clearly documented 1.0 path.
- Expand ecosystem integrations where they align with core architecture.
- Continue performance and operability work driven by measurable SLOs.

## How Roadmap Items Move

Roadmap changes should link to concrete issues/ADRs and include rationale and success criteria.
