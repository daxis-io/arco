# Community

Arco is developed in public. Questions, proposals, and feedback are welcome.

## Where to Participate

- GitHub Issues: bug reports and concrete feature requests.
- GitHub Discussions: design questions, architecture discussion, and usage help.
- Pull Requests: implementation and documentation contributions.

## Communication Norms

- Keep discussions technical and evidence-based.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes over large opaque drops.
- Capture architecture decisions in ADRs.

## Proposing Major Changes

1. Start a discussion with goals, constraints, and tradeoffs.
2. Link related issues and prior decisions.
3. Align on acceptance criteria before large implementation work.
